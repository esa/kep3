what: 
An error occurred while loading the snopt7_c library at run-time. This is typically caused by one of the following
reasons:

- The file declared to be the snopt7_c library, i.e. /usr/local/lib/libsnopt7_c.so, is not a shared library containing the necessary C interface symbols (is the file path really pointing to
a valid shared library?)
 - The library is found and it does contain the C interface symbols, but it needs linking to some additional libraries that are not found
at run-time.

We report the exact text of the original exception thrown:

 
function: evolve_version
where: /home/conda/feedstock_root/build_artifacts/pygmo_plugins_nonfree_1734526829715/work/src/snopt7.cpp, 553
what: The snopt7_c library path was constructed to be: /usr/local/lib/libsnopt7_c.so and it does not appear to be a file
