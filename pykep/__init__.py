"""Pykep is a coolbox for interplanetary trajectory design developed by ESA's Advanced Concepts Team. Its main
 purpose is fast prototyping of reseacrh ideas, and is not intended for operational usage.

 Some important conventions followed:
 1 - All units expected are S.I. (m,sec,kg,N) unless explicitly stated.
 2 - The default set of osculating orbital parameters is, in this order: [sma, ecc, incl, W, w, f], where f is the true anomaly
 3 - The default option to represent epochs as floats is the modified julian date 2000 (MJD2000). By default, time durations are in days."""

    # precision math) are then not found by the LLVM jit machinery.
    # Thus, before importing core, we temporarily flip on the
    # RTLD_GLOBAL flag, which makes the symbols visible and
    # solves these issues. Another possible approach suggested
    # in the llvm discord is to manually and explicitly add
